          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>I currently study computer science, math, environmental science, and Chinese at the
            University of Arizona, graduating May 2020.</p>
          <p>I love composting, farming, and all things sustainable agriculture.</p>
          <p>I am always looking for interesting sustainability projects to work on.
            If you need any software, web development, or business management or development help
          with your project or startup, send me an email! I would love to help in any way I can!</p>

        <h2>about</h2>
        <p> I am in my third year at the University of Arizona double majoring
        in computer science and mathematics and double minoring in environmental science
        and Chinese. </br></br>In terms of programming, I am particularly interested in object-oriented
          programming, web development, embedded software, and working with data.</br></br>I currently work for the University of Arizona
        <a href="https://sustainability.arizona.edu/compostcats">Compost Cats</a> and have lots of prior experience in sustainability work. I have worked in waste management,
        organic farming, and permaculture all over the world in hopes of exploring
        these industries to see where my technological skills can be applied. I hope
        to pursue a career combining sustainable agriculture, software development, and travel.
        </br></br> In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, bouldering and rock climbing, slacklining, and meeting new people.
