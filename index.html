          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>I have a background in computer science, mathematics, environmental science, and Chinese. I am pursuing
          a career in sustainable and urban agriculture with a focus in software development and data management for agriculture.</p>
          <p>I am always looking for interesting sustainability projects to work on.
            If you need any software, web development, business management or project development help, send me an email! I would love to help in any way I can!</p>

        <h2>about</h2>
        <p> I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2020 with a double major
        in computer science and mathematics and double minoring in environmental science
        and Chinese. </br></br>In terms of programming, I am particularly interested in object-oriented
          programming, web development, and working with data.</br></br>I hav prior experience in sustainability work, including
industrial and small scale composting, waste management,
        organic farming, and permaculture in hopes of exploring
        these industries to see where my technological skills can be applied.
        </br></br> In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, traveling, bouldering and rock climbing, slacklining, and meeting new people.
